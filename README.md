# Simplex Optimisation Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of the
Simplex Optimisation Algorithm. The algorithm iteratively 
refines a simplex to find the minimum of a given function.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

### Installing 

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joeezg/Design-Optimisation-Project.git
cd simplex-optimisation
python simplex_optimization.py
```

###
This code is designed to fully stop if there's an error within the subfunctions to ensure accuracy in the output
Unit tests (e.g. convergence function is tested  was conducted on the convergence function to ensure 

###
Seperate functions were created to separate the methods used for each algorithm step. This improves the clarity of the code despite any redundancies created.
